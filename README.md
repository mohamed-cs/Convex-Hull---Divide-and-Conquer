# Convex-Hull-Divide-and-Conquer

<h1>Divide and conquer algorithm convex hull</h1>

<p>The key idea is that is we have two convex hull then, they can be merged in linear time to get a convex hull of a larger set of points. Divide and conquer algorithms solve problems by dividing them into smaller instances, solving each instance recursively and merging the corresponding results to a complete solution.</p>
